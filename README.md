# 💸💸 SafeSign 
### A financial tool that reads, classifies, and extracts risky clauses using NLP & rule-based legal mapping
___
### Problem Statement:
Most users sign financial documents (loan agreements, insurance policies, EMI contracts, credit cards, mutual funds) without fully understanding hidden clauses, because:
- They are written in legal/financial jargon, not plain language.
- Risky clauses like lock-ins, penalty fees, auto-renewals, data-sharing, rejection conditions, and foreclosure charges are buried deep in the document.
- There is no tool that explains these documents simply before signing.
___
## What happens then?
- The common man eventually signs affidavits and legal documentation without knowing the traps and loss of money they lead to.
